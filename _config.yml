project_one: Blog Application
project_one_description: With this application users can post, vote on, share and save links and comments. I built this application using Ruby on Rails. One of the core concepts I learned about through this project is the use of Test Driven Development . It also introduced me to the four basic create, read, update, and delete functions.
